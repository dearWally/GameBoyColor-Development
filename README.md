# GameBoyColor-Development

I wrote code for the GameBoyAdvanced years ago. See [Circuit Cellar Magazine, February 2006](http://www.cc-webshop.com/Circuit-Cellar-Issue-187-February-2006-PDF-FI-2006-187.htm). 

Of course I had a nice XPort cartridge to link my computer to the GBA. There was no hardware work
involved -- just C++ and learning the hardware registers on the GBA.

GBC development is nothing new. There are lots of tutorials on GBC hacking (see the links below).
This repo is a journal of my experience and any code I produced along the way. 

I started with a Game Boy Color and several cartridges I bought from ebay.

The Gameboy Color is backwards compatible with the Gameboy (non color). That means I can start with
simpler programs that don't access the color registers. The cartridge pinouts are the same.

Nice, concise listing of registers and opcode changes:

Here is a cartridge like I am making (I got the idea here). It explains how to remove the existing 
ROM and replace with an FRAM. There is even a circuit here to program the FRAM:

## Development Cartridges

Two of the cartridges (Tarzan and Winnie the Pooh) had clear cases. I chose to hack those.
The screws holding the cartridges together have the Nintendo star-pattern heads. I was able
to carefully unscrew them with needle-nose pliars.

The Tarzan cartridge is very simple: just the ROM and the memory mapper chip. The Pooh cartridge
has a battery-backed RAM in it.

The cartridge is one-sided. It slides into the back of the unit so that the connector pads
and parts are facing out (not in towards the unit).

### ROM and MBC5 Pinout

I decided to start with the simple ROM+MBC. The board is shorter ... more room at the top for an expansion 
board. The pins on the simpler-ROM are farther apart, and it is easier to work with the board. I used
tiny side-cutters to cut the ROM from its surface mount pads. Each pin on the ROM has a corresponding
through-hole pad for me to tag wires into.
